The journey of my PhD.

In time of profound biodiversity crisis, we still know little about biodiversity distribution, which might hinder conservation efforts. I want to understand the distribution of plant biodiversity and where it might be able to survive recent and future climate change.

In my PhD I investigate how structural complex forests are able to buffer climate change and their potential in being save havens for biodiversity.
