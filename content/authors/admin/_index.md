Georg In time of profound biodiversity crisis, we still know little about biodiversity distribution, which might hinder its conservation. I want to understand the distribution of plant biodiversity and its important role for ecosystem functioning.

In my [master thesis](files/master-thesis_final_GH.pdf) I focused on the comparison of the global distribution of functional and phylogenetic diversity in plant communities. To study this topic, I worked with the global plot-based vegetation database [sPlot](https://www.idiv.de/en/splot.html) and created the [phylogenetic backbone](https://www.idiv.de/fileadmin/content/Files_sPlot/Documents/FAMILY-TREE_sPlot3.0.pdf) for the database. Based on this backbone and information on functional traits from the database [TRY](https://www.try-db.org/TryWeb/Home.php) I calculated phylogenetic and functional diversity for 1.8 million vegetation plots. 
While I am currently working in a more bioinformatic environment, I earned practical knowledge as a field assistant during my bachelor studies. I conducted sampling in three different projects at the Biodiversity-Ecosystem Functioning Experiment ([BEF](https://bef-china.com/)) in China, where I learned to set-up experimental designs under a specific research question. I finished my [bachelor thesis](files/bachelorarbeit_georg.haehn_18.08.2020.pdf) with a common garden experiment to investigate plant species effects on litter-decomposition under the supervision of [Remy Beugnon](https://remybeugnon.netlify.app/).
