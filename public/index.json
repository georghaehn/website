Vegetation plot time series are a gold standard in vegetation monitoring, but such data are missing for many regions. Southern Patagonia is an example of a region strongly impacted by climate change but lacking time series data. Monitoring in this region could benefit from a comparison with vegetation survey data gathered between 1975 and 1979, as part of the multidisciplinary research program ‚ÄúTransecta bot√°nica de la Patagonia austral‚Äù (hereafter Transecta). Published in 1985, it contains data on 668 vegetation plots, which were so far inaccessible to most researchers: Transecta has never been reprinted, nor fully digitized, and can only be found in specialized libraries. Here, we created a reproducible workflow, documenting how vegetation plot data from historical sources can be extracted and harmonized. The resulting open-access database we created fills a major regional gap and provides a needed baseline to assess the impacts of global change on southern Patagonia vegetation. By making these data available, we hope to inspire a new generation of vegetation scientists to resurvey the area and continue the legacy of the pioneer researchers who compiled Transecta.","tags":["Diversity","Patagonia","Historical baseline","Vegetation Plots"],"title":"Vegetation of Southern Patagonia in the 1970s ‚Äì Digitization of a gray-literature data set as a monitoring baseline in a changing world","type":"publication"},{"authors":["R√©my Beugnon - Nico Eisenhauer - Helge Bruelheide - Andr√©a Davrinche - Jianqing Du - Sylvia Haider - author - Mariem Saadani - Bala Singavarapu - Marie S√ºnnemann - Lise Thouvenot - Yanfen Wang - Tesfaye Wubet - Kai Xue - Simone Cesarz"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1689120000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1689120000,"objectID":"4132eb331677e47ba011edc34bf31046","permalink":"https://georghaehn.netlify.app/publication/beugnon-et-al-2023/","publishdate":"2023-07-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/beugnon-et-al-2023/","section":"publication","summary":"Forest ecosystems are critical for their carbon sequestration potential. Increasing tree diversity has been shown to enhance both forest productivity and litter decomposition. Litter diversity increases litter decomposability by increasing the diversity of substrates offered to decomposers. However, the relative importance of litter decomposability and decomposer community in mediating tree diversity effects on decomposition remains unknown. Moreover, tree diversity modulation of litterfall spatial distribution, and consequently litter decomposition, has rarely been tested. We studied tree diversity effects on leaf litter decomposition and its mediation by the amount of litterfall, litter species richness and decomposability, and soil microorganisms in a large-scale tree diversity experiment in subtropical China. Furthermore, we examined how litter functional identity and diversity affect leaf litter decomposability. Finally, we tested how leaf functional traits, tree biomass, and forest spatial structure drive the litterfall spatial distribution. We found evidence that tree species richness increased litter decomposition by increasing litter species richness and the amount of litterfall. We showed that soil microorganisms in this subtropical forest perform 84‚Äì87% of litter decomposition. Moreover, changes in the amount of litterfall and microbial decomposition explained 19‚Äì37% of the decomposition variance. Additionally, up to 20% of the microbial decomposition variance was explained by litter decomposability, while litter decomposability itself was determined by litter functional identity, diversity, and species richness. Tree species richness increased litter species richness and the amount of litterfall (+200% from monoculture to eight-species neighborhood). We further demonstrated that the amount of species-specific litterfall increased with increasing tree proximity and biomass, and was modulated by leaf functional traits. These litterfall drivers increased the spatial heterogeneity of litter distribution, and thus litter decomposition. We highlighted multiple biomass- and diversity-mediated effects of tree diversity on ecosystem properties driving forest nutrient cycling. We conclude that considering spatial variability in biotic properties will improve our mechanistic understanding of ecosystem functioning.

Knowledge of broad- scale drivers of phenotypic plasticity is therefore of utmost importance if we are to understand and predict plant responses to global change (Valladares et al., 2014). Although plants are generally plastic (Sultan, 2000), spe- cies and/or populations differ greatly in their levels of plasticity (Dost√°l et al., 2016; Gianoli \u0026amp; Valladares, 2012; Sultan, 2001; Valladares et al., 2000). These differences between species and/or populations may arise due to differences in selective pressures favouring the evolution of increased phenotypic plasticity, but also due to fac- tors limiting its evolution (Alpert \u0026amp; Simms, 2002; van Kleunen \u0026amp; Fischer, 2005; Valladares et al., 2007), which are rarely considered. The main factor known to select for the evolution of increased phenotypic plasticity is environmental het- erogeneity (Alpert \u0026amp; Simms, 2002; V√°zquez et al., 2017). There is substantial evidence that climatic variability is positively associated with plant phenotypic plasticity (Alpert \u0026amp; Simms, 2002; Carvajal et al., 2017; Gianoli, 2004; Gianoli \u0026amp; Gonz√°lez- Teuber, 2005; L√°zaro- Nogal SYNTHESIS Global trends in phenotypic plasticity of plants (DOI)    Disentangling soil microbiome functions by perturbation (DOI)    Realities and hopes in the application of microbial tools in agriculture (DOI)    Direct and indirect effects of global change on mycorrhizal associations of savanna plant communities (DOI)    A hierarchical, multivariate meta-analysis approach to synthesizing global change experiments (DOI)    Coordination between compound-specific chemistry and morphology in plant roots aligns with ancestral mycorrhizal association in woody angiosperms (DOI)    Invertebrate decline reduces bacterial diversity associated with leaves and flowers (DOI)    A practical guide to question formation, systematic searching and study screening for literature reviews in ecology and evolution (DOI)    The flux of root-derived carbon via fungi and bacteria into soil microarthropods (Collembola) differs markedly between cropping systems (DOI)    Relative importance of tree species richness, tree functional type, and microenvironment for soil macrofauna communities in European forests (DOI)    Soil organic carbon response to global environmental change depends on its distribution between mineral-associated and particulate organic matter: A meta-analysis (DOI)    Contrasting responses of above- and belowground diversity to multiple components of land-use intensity (DOI)    Reconstruction of plant‚Äìpollinator networks from observational data (DOI)    Diversity increases yield but reduces harvest index in crop mixtures (DOI)    Conditioning the soil microbiome through plant‚Äìsoil feedbacks suppresses an aboveground insect pest (DOI)    Rice rhizodeposition promotes the build-up of organic carbon in soil via fungal necromass (DOI)    Plant history and soil history jointly influence the selection environment for plant species in a long- term grassland biodiversity experiment (DOI)    Soil fauna diversity and chemical stressors: a review of knowledge gaps and roadmap for future research (DOI)    Biodiversity as insurance: from concept tomeasurement and application (DOI)    Biodiversity‚Äìproductivity relationships are key to nature-based climate solutions (DOI)    Drought resistance and resilience: The role of soil moisture‚Äìplant interactions and legacies in a dryland ecosystem (DOI)    Three-dimensional soil heterogeneity modulates responses of grassland mesocosms to an experimentally imposed drought extreme (DOI)    Non-linear plant-plant interactions modulate impact of extreme drought and recovery on a Mediterranean ecosystem (DOI)    Targeted plant hologenome editing for plant trait enhancement (DOI)    Functional trait effects on ecosystem stability: assembling the jigsaw puzzle (DOI)    A novel trap design forÓÄünon‚Äëlethal monitoring ofÓÄüdung beetles using eDNA metabarcoding (DOI)    Variance, locality and structure: Three experimental challenges in the study of the response of soil microbial communities to multiple perturbations (DOI)    Do large herbivores maintain open habitats in temperate forests?

The facility was first established as a working group funded by sDiv, then assumed as an iDiv research platform. By integrating national and continental vegetation databases, sPlot aims at understanding global patterns in plant diversity across facets, biomes and scales.\nSupervised by Francesco M. Sabatini I prepared and included new vegetation data for the database since 2020. Due to the fantastic supervision I was soon very engaged to the idea of a master thesis investigating how functional and phylogenetic diversity distributes globally in vascular plant communities. To understand this relationship we created the phylogenetic backbone for sPlot and used the existing link to the trait database TRY to calculate functional and phylogenetic diversity for almost two million vegetation plots.

The aim of TreeD√¨ - ÊûóÂú∞ (l√≠n d√¨, forest land) is to understand how tree-tree interactions in local neighborhood of varying diversity translate into the observed positive tree species richness effects on key ecosystem functions at the community scale. Tree-tree interactions range from above- and belowground competition to resource use complementarity and facilitation. In-depth knowledge of each interaction type and interdisciplinary teamwork are essential to understand the underlying processes. All research projects are carried out on the BEF-China platform in subtropical China - the largest forest BEF experiment worldwide.\nIn the sub-project (P8G), I was supervised by R√©my Beugnon focusing on litter functional dissimilarity effects on litter decomposition based on a common garden approach (B.Sc. thesis).\n","date":1590969600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1590969600,"objectID":"a1755b091e5536051060ed32d4d84019","permalink":"https://georghaehn.netlify.app/project/treedi/","publishdate":"2020-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/treedi/","section":"project","summary":"TreeD√¨ - ÊûóÂú∞ - Tree Diversity Interactions: The role of tree-tree interactions in local neighbourhoods in Chinese subtropical forests","tags":["B.Sc","BEF","Soil","Common Garden"],"title":"TreeD√¨","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"c1d17ff2b20dca0ad6653a3161942b64","permalink":"https://georghaehn.netlify.app/people/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/people/","section":"","summary":"Hello!","tags":null,"title":"People","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"https://georghaehn.netlify.app/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"}]
